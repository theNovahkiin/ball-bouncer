# ball-bouncer
Commencing my journey in JavaScript by creating this script to make circles spawn at random locations and move them at a certain speed to make them bounce off the viewport of the browser. The circles' or balls' colors are randomized from a given list of colors and the number of balls to spawn is prompted to the user as input. The circles are modelled using JavaScript classes in an object-oriented approach.
(Note: Movement might look a bit janky on 60Hz monitors as I customized the values in a 165Hz screen. My bad.)
